                           to interact with each other in a unique way, we were limited in our
                           scope to creating a product that was to be used with others at the
                           same time in the same location. Furthermore, this task was
                           exacerbated by the fact that we only had 5 weeks to create a final
                           version with two iterations of rapid prototypes.</p>

                                In the initial stages of our project, we had to pick a field
                                from several different contexts - education, sporting events,
                                concerts / plays, town hall meetings, creative collaborations,
                                gaming meetups, and corporate meetings - in order to focus our
                                creation on a singular objective. We started off by exploring
                                the space of sports games. We performed interviews from people
                                of various sporting backgrounds, ranging from audience members
                                to student athletes.</p>

                                or smoother transition - our team conducted several interviews with sports audience
                                members of various knowledge levels and observed sports games within our viable time
                                period and area. Additionally, we also created observations both from watching a local,
                                college-level baseball game and from watching clips of sports games online. We did this
                                because we wanted to see the interactions that would naturally come about within the
                                audience members during a real game. However, we also wanted to watch clips of sports
                                games online to see the different interactions from a wider range of sports. Furthermore,
                                we wanted to compare and contrast the types of interactions that comes about during
                                higher legure sports games. As a result, we decided to limit our scope to creating an
                                app to be used by audience members of a game in order to enhance their in-game experience.</p>

                                <p>Another idea was to utilize Facebook Events instead of a Facebook Group Chat. This was
                                    done for 2 major reasons. The first is that we had an added constraint of prototyping
                                    for 100 people rather than 20. Because we were now prototyping with a classroom setting,
                                    it would be hard to friend and add every classmate to the group chat. The second major
                                    reason was that we theorized that having a commenting feature would lead to more social
                                    interactions between our users. For example, they could leave hints or commentary on our
                                    app as well as the game itself </p>
                                    <br>
                                <p>Following, we debated several methods about which to go about making a
                                    low-fidelity prototype for testing. Given our limited resources and the
                                    fact that this was only our first prototype, we decided on utilizing
                                    Google Slides, Sheets, and Survey. The prototype would be mostly done
                                    through google slides where we would show clips of the game and ask
                                    trivia questions to audience members.</p>
