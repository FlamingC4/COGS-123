                           to interact with each other in a unique way, we were limited in our
                           scope to creating a product that was to be used with others at the
                           same time in the same location. Furthermore, this task was
                           exacerbated by the fact that we only had 5 weeks to create a final
                           version with two iterations of rapid prototypes.</p>

                                In the initial stages of our project, we had to pick a field
                                from several different contexts - education, sporting events,
                                concerts / plays, town hall meetings, creative collaborations,
                                gaming meetups, and corporate meetings - in order to focus our
                                creation on a singular objective. We started off by exploring
                                the space of sports games. We performed interviews from people
                                of various sporting backgrounds, ranging from audience members
                                to student athletes.</p>

                                or smoother transition - our team conducted several interviews with sports audience
                                members of various knowledge levels and observed sports games within our viable time
                                period and area. Additionally, we also created observations both from watching a local,
                                college-level baseball game and from watching clips of sports games online. We did this
                                because we wanted to see the interactions that would naturally come about within the
                                audience members during a real game. However, we also wanted to watch clips of sports
                                games online to see the different interactions from a wider range of sports. Furthermore,
                                we wanted to compare and contrast the types of interactions that comes about during
                                higher legure sports games. As a result, we decided to limit our scope to creating an
                                app to be used by audience members of a game in order to enhance their in-game experience.</p>

                            <p>After feedback from our class TAs, we pivoted and debated what other platform to facilitate
                                interactions in as a piggyback prototype. One suggestion was using Facebook Live (see left
                                image above) to encourage reactions from our audience. However, we ultimately decided to not
                                utilize the platform for its lack of intuitive usability. Instead, we utilized Facebook
                                Messenger which has a better chat integration and we could use reacts as a way to engage
                                the audience</p>

                                fact that this was only our first prototype, we decided on utilizing
                                Google Slides, Sheets, and Survey. The prototype would be mostly done
                                through google slides where we would show clips of the game and ask
                                trivia questions to audience members.</p>

                            <p>We started off by going back to our original goal:
                                creating an app to be used during a sports game
                                which would enable social interaction within the
                                audience and further engage users in the game.
                                Then, we analyzed each component of the prototype
                                and  asked ourselves, “How does this encourage
                                social interaction?” Firstly, we decided to
                                curate easier questions for our audience, as we
                                had seen from our previous prototype that they
                                had less basketball knowledge than our usergroup,
                                sports fans in an arena. Furthermore, we decided
                                to add a component of hint-giving to help our users
                                and added gifs to make the gameplay more fun and engaging.

                            <p>Another idea was to utilize Facebook Events instead of a Facebook Group Chat. This was
                                done for 2 major reasons. The first is that we had an added constraint of prototyping
                                for 100 people rather than 20. Because we were now prototyping with a classroom setting,
                                it would be hard to friend and add every classmate to the group chat. The second major
                                reason was that we theorized that having a commenting feature would lead to more social
                                interactions between our users. For example, they could leave hints or commentary on our
                                app as well as the game itself </p>

                            <p>Afterwards, we had a meeting in which we chose the screens we wanted to include in our app.
                                Before doing this, we all had slightly different ideas about the the way each person would
                                interact with the app. As a result, we had a conversation in which we talked about each of
                                the screens we created, one by one. We compared each version of the screen and had an open
                                conversation in which we discussed why a screen would or would not work for our app.
                                Ultimately, this helped us do two things. The first is that it allowed us, as a team, to be
                                on the same page with how we wanted our app to look and function. The second is that it
                                caused us to have to justify our design decisions and reflect on why we should or should not
                                included a feature.</p>

                            <p> From our prototyping session we found a few key insights. The first was that our
                                audience really enjoyed the integration of gifs with our prototype; they found
                                the questions to be more entertaining. Another was that there was a decent amount
                                of in-prototype socialization as a good amount of users commented. One thing we
                                struggled with during our first prototype was having audience members interact
                                with each other, so it was good to see that there was this change. Conversely,
                                we found that Facebook events may not be the best platform as there were many
                                technical issues getting to the site. Perhaps, creating an actual app or website
                                would prevent this issue from recurring.

                            <p>Upon further analysis of our results and comparison with legitimate sports games, the success
                                of our product is dubious considering the disparity of forced participation in our testing
                                setting and the fast pace that preludes all decisions. Although certain aspects - trivia
                                questions, for instance - seemed to appeal to the stronger sports fans within our testing
                                pool, the other aspects appealed to more novice sports fans - such as the reactions to plays.
                                This difference in opinion suggests either that our application can appeal to audiences of
                                varying sports knowledge levels or that it may appeal to neither.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>As a result, our confidence in the viability of our prototype cannot be confirmed without
                                further research in a more realistic setting, preferably with a large audience of various
                                sports knowledges and prior practice with the fast pace of the sports game in conjunction
                                with our application. Furthermore, more testing would have to be done to see if the change
                                in the purpose of our app have would have a difference in the interactions and feedback we
                                receive from our testers. Additionally, we would like to test the integration of a customizable
                                avatar  as well as a point system to see the effect these things would have on the engagement
                                of users. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>If this goes well, the next step would be to create an actual app. This app could then be tested
                                to get more realistic interactions from our testers. We would have a better sense of how exactly
                                the app would be used and which features we should or should not integrate. Doing this would also
                                mitigate any of the technical issues we had in both prototyping sessions from getting users onto
                                the prototype itself as the process would be more straightforward. </p>

                            <p>Overall, it’s been an extremely fast-paced five weeks. We’ve gone through the whole double diamond
                                process of design and constantly refined and iterated on our prototype. We’ve learned how to work
                                and communicate effectively as a team. We’ve learned how to divide labor and interpret prototype
                                feedback. Honestly, we’ve learned a lot. Nevertheless, the most important thing we’ve learned is
                                that sometimes things don’t go as planned and that’s all right. Neither of the prototyping sessions
                                had the results we were aiming for. We also had issues with timing for both sessions. Despite this,
                                the experience taught us a great deal about how to design effectively and that the path to success
                                is not always a linear one.</p>
